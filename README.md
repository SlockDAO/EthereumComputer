***Entertainment & Passive Earnings***

The Ethereum Computer is the perfect platform to try out new, exciting applications, and can serve any decentralized app (or ‘Đapp’) from a home theater via HDMI.

In the future, it will become a source of passive income: it's the ideal platform for Ethereum Proof-of-Stake mining, and will come preloaded with pioneering apps, for example to rent one’s hard drive space in exchange for cryptocurrencies.


***Development Platform***

Developers create new revenue streams for Ethereum Computer owners by connecting new devices to the Ethereum Computer, such as wifi routers or large electrical appliances. 

The Slock.it stack is completely open-source: our modular, event based framework can be extended to control any embedded devices using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

The Ethereum Computer is the ideal developement platform: we take care of installing the Ethereum framework and resolving compatibility issues between the various components of the its stack (Whisper, EVM, Web3.js, IPFS/Swarm, etc).
